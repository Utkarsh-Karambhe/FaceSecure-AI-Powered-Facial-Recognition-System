# FaceSecure: AI-Powered Facial Recognition System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
FaceSecure is an AI-powered facial recognition system that enables user authentication based on face recognition. This application uses OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to perform face detection and recognition. Additionally, it integrates anti-spoofing techniques to prevent fake entries.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Face Recognition Login:** Seamless login using face recognition.
- **Anti-Spoofing:** Detects spoof attempts using pre-trained anti-spoofing models.
- **User Registration:** Allows users to register with their facial data and username.
- **Logging:** Logs user login/logout activity with timestamps.
- **Real-time Webcam Feed:** Displays live webcam feed during login and registration.

## ðŸ’» Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Make sure to have Python 3.x installed.
- **Libraries:** Install the necessary libraries using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python pillow face_recognition tkinter

  Hardware Requirements
A webcam (internal or external) for real-time video feed.
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
2. Create Necessary Directories
Ensure the following directories exist:

./db: For storing user face embeddings.
./log.txt: Activity log file is created automatically.
3. Update Anti-Spoof Model Path
Replace the placeholder in the code:

python
Copy code
model_dir='/path/to/anti_spoof_models'
Ensure the anti-spoofing model files are downloaded and the path is correct.

Usage
Run the Application
bash
Copy code
python <script_name>.py
User Actions
Login: Click the "Login" button to authenticate.
Logout: Click the "Logout" button to log out securely.
Register New User:
Click "Register New User."
Enter a username and follow on-screen instructions to register.
