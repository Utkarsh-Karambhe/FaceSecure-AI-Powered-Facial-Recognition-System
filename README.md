# FaceSecure: AI-Powered Facial Recognition System

## üìå Overview
FaceSecure is an AI-powered facial recognition system that enables user authentication based on face recognition. This application uses OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to perform face detection and recognition. Additionally, it integrates anti-spoofing techniques to prevent fake entries.

## üöÄ Features
- **Face Recognition Login:** Seamless login using face recognition.
- **Anti-Spoofing:** Detects spoof attempts using pre-trained anti-spoofing models.
- **User Registration:** Allows users to register with their facial data and username.
- **Logging:** Logs user login/logout activity with timestamps.
- **Real-time Webcam Feed:** Displays live webcam feed during login and registration.

## üíª Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Make sure to have Python 3.x installed.
- **Libraries:** Install the necessary libraries using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python pillow face_recognition tkinter

 Hardware Requirements
A functional webcam (internal or external) for real-time video feed.
‚öôÔ∏è Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Step 2: Create Necessary Directories
Ensure the following directories and files are set up:

./db: Directory for storing user face embeddings.
./log.txt: This file will be created automatically during the first login/logout attempt.
Step 3: Configure Anti-Spoofing Models
Download the required pre-trained anti-spoofing models. Update the model_dir variable in the script:

python
Copy code
model_dir = '/path/to/anti_spoof_models'
Replace /path/to/anti_spoof_models with the actual file path to the anti-spoofing models.

üöÄ Usage
Run the Application
Start the application with:

bash
Copy code
python <script_name>.py
User Actions
Login: Click the "Login" button to authenticate using facial data.
Logout: Click the "Logout" button to securely log out.
Register New User:
Click the "Register New User" button.
Enter a username and follow the on-screen instructions to register your face.
üìÇ Code Structure
Main Class: FaceRecognitionApp
Directories:
./db: Stores user face embeddings as .pickle files.
./log.txt: Logs all user login/logout events.
Key Methods:
